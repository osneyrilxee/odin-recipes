    <h2>Buttered Noodles Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, you can make this incredibly simple dish with just four ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Noodles: This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Butter: You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
        <li>Parmesan: Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper: Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Buttered Noodles Step by step </h2>
    <p>Boil the fettuccine in lightly salted water until it's tender, yet still firm.<br>Drain the pasta in a colander, then return it to the pot. Mix butter, cheese,<br> salt, and pepper into the cooked noodles until all the ingredients are evenly combined.</p>
    <h2>Recipe Tip</h2>
    <p>Use 4 tablespoons of butter if you prefer less saucy noodles.</p>
